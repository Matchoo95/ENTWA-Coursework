ENTWA coursework 2018-2019

http://briggs.myweb.port.ac.uk/WEBP/ENTWA/2018-2019/cwk.htm

# Introduction
The coursework consists of a software development exercise. You are given a problem to solve that requires the development of a dynamic web application using Java EE technologies.

Students are expected to draw on material taught (and material otherwise learned) during all the units on their course in tackling this problem. This assessment thus integrates many of the elements covered during the course.

# Problem
Design and implement a web interface to one of the following problems:

# Project ideas
The School of Computing's MSc project ideas database is currently implemented in a non-MVC style. It also has limited searching functionality. It does not permit people who submit ideas to be able to edit them or withdraw them.

The requirement is to implement better searching and user editing of ideas. Only the owner of an idea (the person who created it) or a designated administrator can edit or withdraw an idea.

# Rules change suggestions
IFAF is the world governing body for American football. Each year, proposals for rule changes are invited. A new system is required to support the proposal making and voting process.

# Online diary
The ability for a community of users to share an online diary and contacts database is a useful one.

Requirements specification

FAQ common to all problems.
